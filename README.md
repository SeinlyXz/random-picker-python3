# random-picker-python3
This program mostly uses Indonesian language to declare the variables and python3 for its base. This program is used to pick random number (like presence number in the school) and determine the group from what the subject it is. This is the basic code to make a calculation, so whenever you wanna try to contribute, please feel free :)
